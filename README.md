# Pomodoro Project

## Introduction
  This is a hobby project of a simple application used to simulate a pomodoro app, used when 
studying and doing tasks where you can have cycles of focus when you are either working, 
doing a small rest or in a long rest.

## Tools Choices
  This repository is implemented in C#, UWP and MVVM Light. The choice of using these
to develop the application is due to my previous knowledge in C# thanks to a few
small personal projects on the Unity3D game engine and my curiosity towards the
Windows applications development workflow. 
  To assist the implementation of a code easy to maintain and increase the complexity if
necessary in the future I chose to use MVVM Light to create a code architecture in which
I divide my project in Views, Models and ViewModels, which is similar to the MVC pattern.
